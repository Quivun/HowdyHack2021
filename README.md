OVERVIEW:
We are making a 2 part project: Youtube Music Player and desktop background visual effects app

PT1--Music player:
    Inputs: Title, youtube link, lyrics, genre?
    Outputs: Music

PT2--Desktop Background:
    Inputs: Genre, Volume--Tempo?
    Outputs: Chrome Overlay, Color, Pulses -- using opacity

Potential Direction:
Implement this with a music player company such as Spotify, which has servers that store all the music available to be played. Our application/program would run off of those songs stored in the server and create the animation overlay on the app as the song is played in real time.
